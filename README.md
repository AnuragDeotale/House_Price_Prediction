# 🏡 Predicting House Prices using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python script that predicts house prices using the **California Housing Dataset**. The model is trained using **Linear Regression**, and various techniques such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Scaling**, and **Model Evaluation** are applied.

---

## 📌 Features
✔️ Uses the **California Housing dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.  
✔️ **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.  
✔️ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Performs correlation analysis and outlier detection using box plots.  
✔️ **Model Training**: Implements **Linear Regression**.  
✔️ **Model Evaluation**: Computes **MSE, MAE, R² Score, and Adjusted R² Score**.  
✔️ **Model Persistence**: Saves and loads the trained model using `pickle`.
